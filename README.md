**By student-to-student evaluation matching system, we increase the number of interactions between students thereby reduce social isolation and increase the quality of education.**

### PROBLEMATICS
Remote learning eliminates peer-review and social interactions of the classes and students are more likely to experience burnouts. It's really **hard to get answers** on university projects, while you are not communicating all the time with other students.

### SOLUTION
We think that **more interactions** between students **can reduce** the effect of social isolation.
We want to enforce students' **communication by** making them **evaluate each other's projects** before the final evaluation by the teacher.

We are involving a peer-to-peer learning system as a service. Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals. Each student needs to evaluate some other student and needs to be evaluated.

**Evaluations** might **positively affect** their **mental health** (by communicating) and **academic performance** (by sharing their knowledge)

### RESEARCH
[Peer education works](https://bit.ly/32ouZgf)

We are sure that this system will work with the standard education system because our whole team is students of School 21 (aka [Ecole42](http://42.fr)) and our education system based only on peer-to-peer learning. If we would have a teacher it would be a great combination of both types of education.

We have interviewed some students from our campus (would they use our service if they were students in university).

30 responses: **93.3%** said yes.

### MAIN BENEFITS OF INVOLVING P2P
* **Enforcing** of making **social connections** for shy people.
* Increasing the quality of education.
* Listening to different descriptions of the same solution may give a **deeper and faster understanding** of a subject.
* **Lot's of conversations** during education (not only listening to the teacher)
* Evaluation is not limited by time, so peers can **discuss the topic deep** and probably become good friends.

### EVALUATION IS IMPORTANT
After evaluations peers leave **feedback on each other**. Feedback is divided into the anonymous and non-anonymous parts. The non-anonymous part contains info on how the peer did his project, and/or how he can improve his skills. The Anonymous part contains a scale of how is peer felt like during evaluation (was he in a good mood or depressed; angry or tired, etc.).

A **specialist** can **access** anonymous **feedbacks** and find out a student who really needs to be helped psychologically or educationally. This will help **provide psychological assistance on time**.

### SCALABILITY
This service can be easily **integrated into** universities' **LMS**. By LMS, the administration may track some social metrics like friendliness, emotional state, academic performance, etc.
This service can not only apply to one university but a group of them.

### DEMO VERSION
We provide some demo-version of "peer to peer" matching system for students with telegram bot and using Python. In the **future**, it can **be a service** that can be involved in the electronic management system of any university!
