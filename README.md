**By student-to-student evaluation matching system, we increase the number of interactions between students thereby reduce social isolation and increase the quality of education.**

### PROBLEMATICS
Remote learning eliminates peer-review and social interactions of the classes and students are more likely to experience burnouts. It's really **hard to get answers** on university projects, while you are not communicating all the time with other students.

### SOLUTION
We think that **more interactions** between students **can reduce** the effect of social isolation.
We want to enforce students' **communication by** making them **evaluate each other's projects** before the final evaluation by the teacher.

We are involving a peer-to-peer learning system as a service. Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals. Each student needs to evaluate some other student and needs to be evaluated.

**Evaluations** might **positively affect** their **mental health** (by communicating) and **academic performance** (by sharing their knowledge)
