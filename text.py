That is how the evaluation works.😌

The university can use feedbacks to find out the student who needs help.😇

It's not a replacement for "classic" evaluation, just an addition to it.👌

Hi there!👋

It's a prototype of our student-to-student 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 evaluation system.

✨Imagine that you're currently studying at university and you have a project which you need to evaluate with the teacher.
🤝Before that, we offer you to get an evaluation from other students which have already done or doing this project now.

Write your name and go ahead!😀
